# Community Metrics
The repository serves as a workspace for collecting input from the GBIF community on the creation of data products derived from GBIF - mediated data that can complement those already provided through GBIF´s data analytics. The goal of this work is to produce new or further develop existing metrics, indicators and time series (trend) data products to support decision making.  

Comparison of a metric, indicator and a time series 
| Product   |  Metric  | Indicator | Time Series |
|:------:   |:------:  |:------:   |:------: |
|Definition |Metrics are raw data points extracted from GBIF datasets|A processed metric that provides insight|A change in an indicator over time|
|Purpose|Basic measurement|Summarizes biodiversity status|Shows whether things are improving or declining|
|Structure|Numerical value (e.g., count, area, %, etc.)|Aggregated value (e.g., index, composite score)|Time-series graph, rate of change|

Below are a list of examples and we hope to build on these through their active development (where feasible) and through the addition of supplementary analytics suggested by our community as issues.

# Examples
## Potential Metrics (Basic Measurements)
- Number of species occurrences in a given area
  - Example: 10,000 bird occurrences recorded in the Amazon Rainforest in 2023.
- Number of unique species recorded
  - Example: 150 butterfly species recorded in Madagascar from 2000–2023.
- Number of observations of an endangered species
  - Example: 120 sightings of the Javan Rhino in Ujung Kulon National Park.
- Geographical range of a species (km²)
  - Example: The range of the Bengal Tiger based on verified GBIF occurrences.
- Temporal distribution of observations
  - Example: 20% of bat observations in Europe occur in summer months.

## Potential Indicators (Summarized Metrics)
- Species Richness Index (SRI) – The total number of species recorded in a specific area.
  - Example: SRI = 500 species recorded in the Congo Basin in 2023.
- Species Evenness Index – Measures how evenly individuals are distributed among species.
  - Example: Some forests may have high species richness but low evenness due to a few species dominating the dataset.
- Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) – Compares current species composition to historical baselines.
  - Example: The BII for the Amazon = 72%, meaning 28% biodiversity loss compared to pre-industrial times.
- Endemism Index – The proportion of species found only in a specific region.
  - Example: 50% of amphibians in Madagascar are endemic.
- Sampling Effort Indicator – Measures how well an area has been sampled using GBIF data.
  - Example: The Amazon rainforest has low sampling coverage, while the UK has extensive sampling.
- Human Impact Indicator – Measures the number of species occurrences in human-modified landscapes.
  - Example: 40% of mammal occurrences in Europe come from urban or agricultural areas

## Time Series (Trends Over Time)
- Species Range Shift Trend – Tracks how species distributions are changing due to climate change.
  - Example: GBIF records show that the European Bee-eater (Merops apiaster) has expanded 200 km northward over 30 years due to rising temperatures.
- Population Decline Trend – Uses occurrence data to infer population trends.
  - Example: 10% decline in elephant occurrences in protected areas over 20 years.
- Invasive Species Spread Trend – Tracks the increase in occurrences of invasive species over time.
  - Example: The spread of Lionfish (Pterois spp.) in the Atlantic Ocean, mapped using GBIF data from 1980–2023.
- Deforestation & Habitat Loss Impact Trend – Shows biodiversity loss in deforested areas.
  - Example: Species richness in the Amazon decreased by 15% over 30 years based on GBIF records.
- Phenological Shift Trend – Tracks changes in seasonal activity of species (e.g., migration, flowering).
  - Example: GBIF records show that butterflies in Europe emerge 10 days earlier than 50 years ago.
- Protected Area Effectiveness Trend – Measures species presence inside vs. outside protected areas over time.
  - Example: Tiger occurrences have increased by 20% in protected areas over the past decade, while declining outside.
